# Exploring-Teamcenter-The-SQL-Way
Hi There,

This is a repository that gives somes samples and explains how to navigate the different Teamcenter classes so that you can now easily associate the database tables to build complex queries.

Teamcenter is a highly structured database with different tables for different categories of objects like Dataset, Items, Item Revisions etc. Since this table organization is an internal development detail, this information does not get listed in the official Teamcenter documentation.

With the knowledge I accumulated for the time that I have spent on it, I constructed this wiki that explains the database table organization better. I have listed this information here https://github.com/pawanit17/Exploring-Teamcenter-The-SQL-Way/wiki

I strongly suggest you to practise these on your environment ( preferrably via a READ-ONLY account ).

Learning is always great and so I wish you to have a great time querying :P.

Thanks,
Pavan.
